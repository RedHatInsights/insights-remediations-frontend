# insights-remediations-frontend

This is the frontend application for [Insights Remediations](https://github.com/redhatinsights/insights-remediations). It is based on the [insights-frontend-starter-app](https://github.com/redhatinsights/insights-frontend-starter-app).

## Getting Started

### Running the application

1. install and start the dev server in an environment of your choice:

```sh
npm i
npm run start
```
While you run the command above, you will be prompted to choose an enviroment.

2. Open browser with the URL generated by the webpack dev server your terminal


### Running with another app

If you want to see changes made in remediations button or wizard in another application you will have to run both remediations and desired application. We'll take for example [insights-advisor-frontend](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-advisor-frontend) application as app that uses system detail.

#### With webpack proxy
Open new terminal and navigate to desired application (for instance insights-adviror-frontend) and run it (make sure to run it on different port)
```
npm start
```

Run the remediations application with proxy enabled and list of additional applications
```
LOCAL_API=advisor:8003~https npm run start:proxy
```

If you want to run advisor and for instance vulnerability just add new entry to LOCAL_API
```
LOCAL_API=advisor:8003~https,vulnerability:8004
```

### Testing

Run `npm run verify` to run build, linters and tests

Use `remediations:debug` localStorage entry to unlock testing utilities in the UI (`localStorage.setItem('remediations:debug', true)`)

### Releases

Any change commited to the `master` branch is automatically promoted to `/preview` in all environments.
Any change commited to the `stable` branch is automatically promoted to the main version of the application in all environments.
